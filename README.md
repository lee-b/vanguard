# Vanguard

# Overview

This is intended to be a modern re-implementation of Nightscout.  Pre-pre-pre-alpha status; not usable yet.

It aims to be:

* A lot easier to set up and install
* More secure, especially for sharing data. Perhaps advanced sharing features, like highlighting particular patterns and issues and consulting a community.
* Perhaps automated analytics, like "You may need to reduce your basal, or decrease your bolus ratio at this time of day. To confirm which, do a basal test at this time tomorrow."
* More powerful, especially in terms of analytics
* More modern, in terms of look and feel and speed etc.
* More feature-complete, in terms of fully supporting basals, all macronutrients, etc.
* High-performance, asynchronous code
* Well-tested
* Clean, readable, maintainable code.
* Type-safe, fool-proof code, wherever reasonably possible
